    help people learn language with a help of language model. There are number of modes of the app.
    Firstly, sentence translation. There will be number of sentences in the language that you choose. 
    You will have to translate that to english and submit, in which the model will tell you how well you did, and 
    a good example of the translation. Secondly, there is a vocabulary test. There will be number of words generated by the 
    AI, and you will have to translate them. Thirdly, there is a conversational AI. You can freely talk to the AI, and it will give
    two answers. Firstly, it will give you a response to whatever you said, it the chosen language. Secondly, it will give you
    feedback on what you said, such as any grammatical errors, or any words that you could have used instead. Enjoy!"""
